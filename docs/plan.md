# plan

* [x] make subscript generate lispy tree (wasm, wat, js, ast targets are possible)
  . we need not immediately compile, we need intermediary state to codegenerate after.
  . parsing time can be improved via wasm version;
  * [x] ~~make subscript generate wasm binary for evaluator.~~ nah, later
    * Example: https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/asm/wasm.html

* [x] Watr
  * [x] compiler
  * [x] parser: very basic commands, no legacy
  * [x] Compare vs wabt, wat-compiler
  * [ ] Repl with compiler selector

* [ ] stdlib
  * cos, sin, pow, mod

* [ ] @audio/gain module
  * compiles basic son file to multicased function `gain`
  * [ ] wasm gain node: browser
  * [ ] wasm gain node: node

* [ ] Minimal set:
  * [ ] common expressions
  * [ ] name(a,b,c) = body.
  * [ ] *state
    * [ ] instances state can be allocated as global variables in advance by stacktrace
  * [ ] . end operator

* [ ] compile every trick from basic wasm tutorial

* [ ] implement sonr expressions
  * `sin(432 + 10*sin(8)) * adsr(0, 0, .4, 0)`

* [ ] implement zzfx

* [ ] web-audio-api

* [ ] [musicdsp](https://github.com/bdejong/musicdsp/tree/master/source)
* [ ] [sndkit](https://github.com/paulbatchelor/sndkit)

* [ ] Compare to alternatives: rust, soul, elementary-audio

* [ ] fourier-transform

## Test cases

* sonr expressions
* FM, AM signals sin(f + sin(m) * 100), sin(f) * (cos(m) + 1)
* weighted mixing signals sin(a) * .75 + cos(b) * .25
* periodic wave eg. wave(1204) - seed indicates overtone weights
* ZZFX sound board
* web-audio-api for node
* mixing: `+`, `-`, `*` and `mix(a,b,c)`
* amplifying: `a*x` and `| gain(amt)`
* shifting: `a | delay(±1s)`
* stretching (pitch): `a | rate(1.05)`
* inverting: `-a`
* reversing direction: `a | reverse(x)`?
* join/concat: `a|trim(..2s) + b|delay(2s) + c|delay(4s))`?
* static shift: `a+c`
* multiplexing: `a > 2 ? x : a > 1 ? y : z` and `mux(select, a, b, c, ...)`?
* input: recording, file etc: `mic()`, `file()`
* loop: `%`? `a | repeat(2)`? `a.repeat(2)`? `a(t % 2)`?
* trim: `a / dur`? `dur&&a`? `a(min(t, dur))`?
* cap/limit/compress max/min/clamp?
* pan, channels: `a & b`?
* math stdlib: common function names exposed from `Math`?
* adsr: `a * adsr(params)`? `a | adsr(params)`?
* convolve: `a ^ b`?
* filters `a | lp(f, q)`? `a | filter(type, f, q)`?
* effects: crush, curve, unisson, flanger etc.  `a | crush(param)`?
* map `a | abs(it)`? `a | abs($)`?
* get sample:  `a[x]`? `a.at(x)`? or sample-less fns?
* get channel: `a[0]`?
* get value at a time `a(t)`?
* integrate: `∫(a, dt)`? `acc(a, dt)`?
